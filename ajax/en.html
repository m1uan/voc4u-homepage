                Most important part of Voc4u is hidden under button Train. Here you will <b>loudly memorize</b> translation of <b>word</b> on top in blue bar (on top) or at-least in your memory. If you can’t or you are not sure about translation, press the “don’t know” button. If you will use the app in right way (right use buttons “know” and “don’t know”) the app will repeat the words you’ve had trouble with more ofen. Important is also allways <b>repeat</b> the words marked by red <b>color</b>. Actualy is similar like write down vocabulary into paper and hide one side by hand and try guess what is under hand, but with difference the paper is dinamicaly change how progress you do.
